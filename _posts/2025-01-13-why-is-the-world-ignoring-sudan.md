Ukraine is stricken by war. Gaza faces constant bombardment and near-total devastation. Los Angeles, gripped by flames, saw thousands made homeless overnight. The looming spectre of Donald Trump’s return to power, now only days away. These stories have filled our news channels and For You pages for the last 12 months - and rightly so, critical in keeping the powers that be accountable for their actions, if not right now then at least in the hopefully near future. 

But in a world of constant doomscrolling, Sudan’s anguish barely registers, with scant reporting and laissez-faire attention on the mechanics of a war that is choke-holding the region and its people.

The global appetite for tragedy is insatiable - a macabre voyeurism fed by dark headlines and distant suffering. So with an estimated 150,000 lives lost and over 11 million displaced, why is the world turning away from Sudan?


#### The Weight of Anti-Blackness

Back in November, a member of the protest group London for Sudan spoke to me about this very issue. Having assembled a small but powerful demonstration outside the Emirates stadium, a gutsy move given the Liverpool-induced temperament of Arsenal fans, principle organiser Lulu voiced a hard truth: that Sudan’s invisibility is rooted in anti-Blackness.

“Just Africans fighting again,” she said, distilling the dismissiveness of the narratives that permeate mainstream media and government agendas. A stark reflection of how the violence in Sudan is trivialised, her words stuck like a slap.

Anti-Blackness - the systemic devaluation and marginalisation of Black lives - is unfortunately nothing new. Entrenched in Euro-American legacies of historical exploitation and postcolonial neglect, this racism is a result of the structures and systems that have over centuries prioritised certain colonial lives while rendering indigenous populations invisible. 

Decades of British and Egyptian colonial rule thus left a fractured Sudan, with its 1956 independence marked by fault lines of ethnic, regional, religious, and political strife, largely ignored by the powers that created them. Western indifference to Sudan, and African countries at large, is thereby compounded by an unwillingness to confront complicitness in creating these fractures and subsequent tensions. 

When coupled with the Western media’s racial empathy bias, where proximity to whiteness often dictates whose pain is seen or felt (the reporting on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine comes to mind, where refugees were described as Christian, white, and European to emphasise shock and horror), it becomes clear why the Sudan crisis struggles to gain the urgent traction it deserves.

Rather than an oversight, these biases are a damning reflection of global systems that have long dehumanised and dismissed African lives. Sudan’s plight is not inevitable, another chapter in a tired story of African conflict; it is the outcome of deliberate neglect and a failure to reckon with the enduring legacies of colonialism and racial hierarchies.


#### Power Struggles and Proxys 

On April 15, 2023, the threads holding Sudan together snapped. The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, clashed with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. Two factions who once cooperated to oust dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019, these allies became enemies through a struggle for power; and what was meant to herald a civilian-led future devolved into a bitter war.

While it is easy to simply label the war as a struggle between two power-hungry generals, conflict is increasingly entangled with international interests. Egypt has supplied arms to the SAF, while the UAE has funnelled weapons to the RSF, reportedly via Chad. Libya and South Sudan, though not officially aligned, have seen fuel flows reach the RSF. Eritrea is hosting training camps for SAF-affiliated armed groups, and even Ukrainian special forces are allegedly engaging RSF fighters alongside Russian mercenaries.
 
To obscure matters further, Sudan’s conflict isn’t merely a case of proxy warmongering between antagonistic nations. Egypt and the UAE, the two main external backers of the SAF and RSF respectively, demonstrate this clearly, as they maintain close ties despite supporting opposing factions. Their involvement in Sudan is not indicative of a direct rivalry, but of strategic calculations that are rooted in their own regional interests.

It is this web of international meddling has transformed what could have been a short conflict into an enduring nightmare, with civilians finding themselves trapped by warmongering external actors extending the violence through funds, weapons, and strategic interests.

#### "We Thought the War Would End"

“We tried to stay as long as we could,” says Duaa Ismail Abdulla, a 4th-year architecture student at Khartoum University, calling me via a shaky Google Meet. She and her family, believing the war would be short-lived, initially chose to remain in their home in the Ombudsman district of the city. 

“We thought the war would end soon. But during these five months, there were people being killed, and a lot of checkpoints where citizens are imprisoned… it was difficult to live there.”

Duaa pauses as she recalls the abrupt escalation of violence, as the RSF grew in strength and numbers. “Suddenly the soldiers were everywhere, with powerful weapons. They were waging war against the citizens, and many of them weren’t even Sudanese. We didn’t know where they came from. I’m not an expert, but as a citizen, I’m sure there is something going on.” Her voice cracks.

Duaa’s experiences are emblematic of the terrifying reality faced by countless civilians in Sudan. What was initially expected to be a short-lived conflict has dragged on for almost two years, turning the lives of those caught in the crossfire upside down. 

Insisting that she is “lucky to be displaced”, her family fled to the North of the country, where occasional internet connection and the unwavering support from her supervisor and colleagues has allowed Duaa to slowly continue her studies, even presenting a paper on the use of AI in the revitalisation of cultural heritage in Kigali, aged just 22. 

Duaa's testimony brings into sharp focus the human cost of the war, whilst revealing the troubling reality of foreign involvement in prolonging the violence.

#### A War Left to Burn

What makes this war so insidious isn’t just its violence - it’s the silence that surrounds it. The conflict drags on, sustained by a cocktail of greed and global indifference. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the UAE have bloodied their hands through their active involvement - arming and financing the warring factions - while simultaneously engaging in strategic distractions, such as sportswashing, to divert international scrutiny from their complicity. 

In the meantime, Sudan and its people are caught in the crossfires between proxies and power struggles, left to choke under the weight of a brutal war that millions are trying to escape. It’s not just a failure of empathy; it’s a failure of accountability. 

The war doesn’t lack horror, far from it. What it lacks is an audience.
