**Black and Asian women in the UK are up to three times more likely to die during pregnancy than their white counterparts, according to new findings from the national charity MBRRACE-UK.** 

Drawing on data from 2020 to 2022, the UK-wide Maternal, Newborn and Infant Clinical Outcome Review Programme reveals deeply entrenched racial disparities in maternity care, fuelling renewed calls for reform to tackle institutional biases in the NHS.

Trish Balusa, a maternity care activist and Black mother, shared her story of having to persistently advocate for her health during her second pregnancy. When still in her second trimester, Balusa felt the stitching from her previous birth beginning to tear; despite reporting her pain, she was initially sent home. 

Reflecting on the experience with friends, Balusa realised the stark difference in treatment that women of colour often face. “The experience isn’t the same for everyone,” she said.

While maternal mortality rates for ethnic minorities are improving over the years, disparities remain significant. Nana-Adwoa Butcher, a co-host of the Black Mums Upfront podcast, maintains that persisting racial biases in the NHS can lead to Black mothers being overlooked in maternity wards. 

Revealing how a friend who qualified as a midwife eight years ago was taught “that black women can endure more pain,” Butcher emphasised how this leads to “white mothers, side by side with Black mothers on the ward, [being] seen first, even if the Black mother urgently needs attention”. Pointing out the “ridiculous” unscientific assumptions around pain tolerance, Butcher underscored the need for urgent NHS reform to help save the lives of vulnerable Black and Asian women.

Acknowledging the ingrained biases that the NHS has yet to confront, The Race and Health Observatory’s Policy Lead for Maternity Arnie Putnis insists that progress is underway. 

The Royal College of Midwifery, Putnis explained, has introduced a “decolonising curriculums toolkit” aimed at addressing racial biases and dismantling harmful narratives. Moreover, the toolkit encourages healthcare professionals to recognise these biases, through challenging assumptions about Black and Asian women, and expanding the studies upon which maternity research is conducted.

Responding to the developments that are underway across NHS Maternity Care, Balusa welcomes such shifts in education as crucial in preventing further tragic outcomes. 

“Putting [these conversations] into the learning for healthcare professionals will make such a big difference, as we don’t know our biases until they come - and unfortunately for black women, it’s when we are dying.”
