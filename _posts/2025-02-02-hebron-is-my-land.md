Asma’s day starts bright and early. A medical student in her 5th year, she wakes up before 6am so she can make it on time to the hospital where she is completing her residency. If she was to travel on her city’s main highways, it would take her less than half an hour to get to work in the morning. 

But Asma lives in Hebron, a divided muhafada or governate, where the roads you travel by are hinged on your citizen status. The highways that connect her home and hospital are under Israeli military control, fortified with temperamental entrances that restrict access to and from the city centre, subject to closure at a moment’s notice. When this happens, Asma’s journey becomes an unpredictable combination of taxis down side-streets, busy crossings and walking alongside the main roads on her way to the hospital. Her commute turns into an unnecessary hour and fifteen trial.

“They shut the entrances, and you don't know which day. It is not steady. Once, I was 20 minutes late for my exam because they didn’t want to let people through. In these cases, yanni, I have to go through the secondary streets, where I can get into Hebron City. I walk all along the street, and of course, while you are walking, there are settlers in their cars. I’ll get to the other side, and I’ll take a taxi to go where I want. It's horrific during winter, yanni.”

A long-standing hub of commercial activity, Hebron is the second-largest Palestinian city in the West Bank, constituted by a network of smaller towns and cities that are tenuously connected by these temperamental entrances. Home to the sacred Tomb of Abraham, it is a holy place for Muslims, Christians and Jews alike; but it is a heavily contested space too, criss-crossed with apartheid-style segregations and zones that denounce Palestinian access. 

Much like the rest of the West Bank, Hebron is split into Zones A, B, and C (Palestinian Authority-control, shared-control, and Israeli-control respectively). However, Hebron also has its own set of regulations that sets the occupied city apart. Stemming from the 1994 massacre of 29 Palestinians as they prayed, the Hebron Protocol is a system that heavily restricts the movement into, out of, and within the city. For 28 years, Palestinians and Israeli settlers have been segregated by the H1 and H2 zoning restrictions that carve up the governate. 

On paper, the Palestinians seem to have gotten the better ‘deal’, with the Arab H1 zones accounting for roughly 80% of the region. However, these spaces crucially exclude what was once Hebron’s social, commercial, cultural, religious, and historical centre, creating a complicated maze for people like Asma trying to go about their daily lives. The result? Access into the city is curtailed through temperamental gated entrances, and key roads within the centre are themselves hinged on your citizenship.

Nowhere is more emblematic of such segregation than the iconic al-Shuhada Street. Designated H2 and transformed from the city’s main meeting point to a ghost town with shuttered blinds and bolted doors, the paved road that buzzed with lively markets, rich with the smells of fresh produce and constant chatter of residents as they drink their chai or qahwe, now sits under the watchful gaze of the Israeli military, open for Israelis and tourists only. Its nickname, Apartheid Street, holds no space for confusion.

Yet despite being under military control, around 30,000 Palestinians still live in the H2 Old City on roads such as al-Shuhada, alongside 800 Israeli residents who are protected year-round by the IDF. Blue-and-white flags litter the streets here, and the Palestinian residents must navigate the narrow sidestreets and cramped underpasses, even accessing their properties through neighbours’ balconies rather than the H2 pavements, with nets draped across winding passages to prevent rocks and garbage being thrown at them.  

“We feel unsafe but, for me, I have never been afraid. I walk as I have always walked on any street, though a lot of time [the soldiers] are there, standing and pointing their weapons. But I know that this is my land, why do I have to be afraid? I’m walking in my holy land, in my country. This makes it less hard to face.”

For anyone needing to pass through H2 zones, this means queueing in one of many checkpoints, notorious for unwarranted delays to unprovoked arrests. The added pressure of IDF soldiers, some just teenagers on their 2-year mandatory service, stings in particular as a constant reminder that the movements of Palestinians in the West Bank are dictated by the whims of whoever is on guard.

“I tried to take pictures of them, but I was afraid for them to see me. But they are just teenagers. And, you know, someone who is 18, 19, it is in their features that they are very young. A lot are Western. And they are controlling our lives. One of my colleagues lives in H2, and often he cannot get to the hospital because they have closed the checkpoints.”

For many, living with such surveillance would be unbearable. Asma however is fortunate to live in Hebron’s H1 suburbs, in a large three-storey family house surrounded by quiet schools, Kindergartens and local shops. Her future as a doctor is bright; and she spends her days studying, socialising, and tutoring Arabic to her online students. Keen to emphasise that the Palestinian existence is more than a one-dimensional reflection against Israeli occupation, she discusses her plans to complete her medical placements abroad - perhaps to Spain, as she has been teaching herself the language. 

Yet on whether she or her family would permanently move away from Palestine, leaving the occupation beyond to join the 6-million-strong diaspora, her tone is firm and resolute.

“In my opinion, I prefer to die in Palestine. The idea of being a refugee is something I cannot accept, both for me and my family. We stay in Palestine, and we live in our country with our dignity.”
